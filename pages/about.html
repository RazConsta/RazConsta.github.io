        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>I am a rising sophomore at University of Washington Tacoma pursuing a
            <a href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/computer-science-systems-home" target="_blank"
                title="Click here for a description of the program">BS in Computer
                Science and Systems</a> and my current goal is to secure a internship for summer 2021 or summer 2022. I
            enjoy programming, math and tech. My history with programming goes back to fifth grade, when I enrolled
            in my school's programming club, where we learned Pascal. However, after a couple of months, the club faced
            some funding issues and was disbanded. After a long break, I resumed
            programming in 9th grade through my high school's C++ classes. Following that, AP Computer Science in
            12th grade introduced me to Java and the beauty of object-oriented programming. From there, it was
            pretty clear to me that I should follow a computer science path in college, and I am currently doing
            so and loving every moment of it.
        </p>

        <p>When I am not studying, some of my hobbies include gaming, going to the movies and biking.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: I have included the dark mode option because I have some eye floaters and white backgrounds
            slightly annoy me.
